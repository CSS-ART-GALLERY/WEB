                    <h2>Artesian Well</h2>
                    <p>In the early 1930s residents of Barrio Tankulan used an aretesian well for water source. 
                        The well was constructed through the effort of Barrio Officials under the leadership of 
                        Presidente del Barrio Mateo Gumaling. Due to its abundance, the American Soldiers used to
                         draw water from this well during World War II. The preservation of this Artesian Well exhibits
                          the beginnings of Manolo Fortich and it serves as a tribute to the early leaders and people of
                           Barrio Tankulan now the capital center of the town.</p>

                         province’s reputation as one of the largest pineapple producers in the Philippines. The landmark,
                          located within the territory of the Del Monte Pineapple Plantation—one of the world's largest pineapple
                           plantations—stands as a symbol of the area’s agricultural heritage. Camp Phillips was established 
                           during the early 20th century when Del Monte began its operations in the Philippines, transforming
                            Bukidnon into a hub for pineapple production. Surrounded by lush greenery, neatly paved pathways,
                             and towering trees, the site is a popular stop for tourists seeking to experience the history and 
                             significance of Bukidnon’s pineapple industry. The overcast sky in the backdrop adds a serene and

                    <p>Manolo Fortich is a home of several historical artifacts; one of these is the Japanese Stone
                         Marker which indicates the graves of high-ranking Japanese Officials killed during World War
                          II. The elliptical one by two feet stone bears two Japanese inscriptions which translated
                           as “On this spot died Miyazaki Yoshitoi, Chief of Army” and “Emperor Chiao” in addition 
                           to the English inscription which reads “ In memory of Kaji Battalion, May 8, 1942”. 
                           The stone was placed by Japanese soldiers relatives of Miyazaki Yoshitoi to remember him 
                           with. This is a post-world war or else, the marker would have been written all in Japanese
                            specially the one line written in English “In memory of Kaji Battalion, May 8, 1942”. 
                            Miyazaki Yoshitoi, must have been the highest ranking official of the Kaji Battalion 
                            killed in action. By May 9, 1942, General Sharp ordered his men to Surrender.</p>

                    <h2>Philippine eagle</h2>
                    <p>The Philippine eagle named "Kalabugao" currently resides and nests within the forests of Mt. Tago, Guilang-Guilang, Manolo Fortich. After being rescued and rehabilitated in the Philippine Eagle Center for 6 years in Davao, Kalabugao returned to her home in Mt. Tago where she also found her lifetime mate named “Guilang-Guilang.” The said pair is now raising a 6-month-old eaglet and was named “Maluko.” This is a victory for their species given that Philippine eagles are known to be monogamous and will only lay a single egg every two years. This reduces their rate of reproduction, thus, making them one of the rarest, most critically endangered species.

                        To protect Kalabugao and her family, the Philippine Eagle Foundation, Department of Environment and Natural Resources, the Local Government of Manolo Fortich, and the residents of Brgy. Guilang-Guilang team up to create policies and other measures to ensure that they will not be harmed in their habitat.</p>
